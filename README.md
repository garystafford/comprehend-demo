# Amazon Comprehend Samples/Demonstration

Example of several types of [Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/) analyses: Sentiment, Syntax, Entity
detection, Topic modeling (arbitrary 5 topics), and Key phrases detection. Analyses performed using the `boto3` Python SDK for Comprehend.

## Analysis Sources
 - The March 25, 2021 [U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/clarida20210325a.htm) speech, given at the 2021 Institute of International Finance Washington Policy Summit, Washington, D.C..

- Amanda Gorman's poem, 'The Hill We Climb', read at Joe Bidenâ€™s 2021 Presidential Inauguration.

## Textual Content

See the [content](./content) directory for text content used for the analysis. Note Sentiment analysis with Amazon Comprehend is limited to only 5,000 bytes. Thus, the Monetary Policy speech had to be split into two halves for only the Sentiment
analysis.

## Python Scripts

- The [comprehend_v1.py](comprehend_v1.py) Python 3 script was used to perform all analyses for the longer Monetary Policy speech.

- The [comprehend_v2.py](comprehend_v2.py) Python 3 script was used to perform all analyses for the shorter Amanda Gorman poem.


## Analysis Results
